## Installation
💽 
You’ll need to use the pg package to connect to your PostgreSQL database and perform queries, and the Inquirer package to interact with the user via the command line. This can be done via the command "npm i" if you have the correct dependencies included on the package.json file.


## Usage
🖱️ 
To use the application simply open two terminals. One will operate psql terminal and the other will operate the bash terminal for your dependencies. 
For the psql terminal execute these commands:
- psql -U postgres
- [Enter in password]
- \i ./db/schema.sql
- \i ./db/seeds.sql
- Now switch to your bash terminal and execute these commands:
- npm i 
- npm start

And then begin using the display menu.
